Current/past implementations used suboptimal image processing algorithms, so many images are v. low res. Input images are scaled down so the simulation can run reasonably fast on personal PCs. pyGAD library could probably make this better

images in this directory were generated with images from the input folders. results will probably be hard to see on a browser
