Before the genetic simulation begins, the input image is downsized to a reasonable resolution so the algorithm can run in a reasonable amount of time. In order to clearly see the resulting (output) images, you must download them (the Github website does not support zooming). The sample inputs are way too large to run with the current selection/mutation/mating algorithms, but I have plans to change this in the future (with neural networks). Currently, however, the algorithm is capable of producing somewhat accurate pixel art with anywhere from 16 to 128 pixels. Sometimes, the random alterations introduced by the evolution simulation make interesting images (which was my goal when I started this project).
