# Genetic Pixel Art | Simulating Evolution For Image Reconstruction

Code has no UI so custom inputs require you to change the image path in the code.
Currently, this project is somewhat incomplete, but also still somewhat functional. If you would like to test it, you'd need to download all source files and edit the input image path + maybe simulation parameters.
