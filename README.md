# Genetic Pixel Art | Simulating Evolution For Image Reconstruction

Currently, this project is somewhat incomplete, but also still somewhat functional. If you would like to test it, you'd need to download all of the source files and edit the input image path / simulation parameters in the code (mostly in simulate.py, but genetics/evolution.py also allows customization of crossover/breeding/mutation algorithms). I have plans to put demonstration pictures/content here and possibly an easy interface to edit parameters (without needing to change code), but when I eventually come back to this project, my focus will be on neural networks and expanding the image reconstruction capabilities to larger images. Currently, any size parameter larger than 150-200px along with 1000+ generations takes an absurd amount of time, so the current capabilities only involve pixel art (the input images, however, can be any size because they are scaled down by the code).
