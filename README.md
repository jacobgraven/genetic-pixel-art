# Genetic Pixel Art | Simulating Evolution For Image Reconstruction

Currently, this project is somewhat incomplete yet also still functional. If you would like to test it, you'd need to download all the python files and edit the image path / simulation parameters (mostly in simulate.py; genetics/evolution.py also allows customization of crossover/breeding/mutation algorithms). I have plans to put demonstration pictures here and possibly an easy interface to edit parameters (without needing to change code) but when I come back to this project, my focus will be on neural networks and expanding the image reconstruction capabilities to larger images (currently any size parameter larger than 150-200px + 1000 generations takes an absurd amount of time).
